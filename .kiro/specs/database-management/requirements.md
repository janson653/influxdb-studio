# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance InfluxDB Studio with comprehensive database and measurement management capabilities, along with a UI redesign for a more modern, geek-style interface. The enhancements will allow users to create, delete, and list databases and measurements directly from the application interface, improving workflow efficiency for database administrators and developers working with InfluxDB time-series databases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Management

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to manage InfluxDB databases (create, delete, list) through the UI, so that I can perform database maintenance tasks without using command line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the database section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all available databases from the connected InfluxDB instance.
2. WHEN the user clicks on a "Create Database" button THEN the system SHALL display a dialog with necessary input fields for creating a new database.
3. WHEN the user submits the create database form with valid inputs THEN the system SHALL create a new database in the connected InfluxDB instance.
4. WHEN the user selects a database and clicks on a "Delete Database" button THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog.
5. WHEN the user confirms database deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the selected database from the InfluxDB instance.
6. WHEN database operations succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success or error notifications.
7. WHEN the user refreshes the database list THEN the system SHALL update the list with the current state from the InfluxDB server.

### Requirement 2: Measurement Management

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want to manage measurements (create, delete, list) within a selected database, so that I can organize my time-series data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a database THEN the system SHALL display a list of all measurements within that database.
2. WHEN the user clicks on a "Create Measurement" button THEN the system SHALL display a dialog with necessary input fields for creating a new measurement.
3. WHEN the user submits the create measurement form with valid inputs THEN the system SHALL create a new measurement in the selected database.
4. WHEN the user selects a measurement and clicks on a "Delete Measurement" button THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog.
5. WHEN the user confirms measurement deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the selected measurement from the database.
6. WHEN measurement operations succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success or error notifications.
7. WHEN the user refreshes the measurement list THEN the system SHALL update the list with the current state from the InfluxDB server.

### Requirement 3: Geek-Style UI Optimization

**User Story:** As a technical user, I want a modern, geek-style interface for the application, so that I can have a more engaging and efficient user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a dark-themed interface with high contrast elements suitable for technical users.
2. WHEN the user interacts with the application THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with subtle animations and transitions.
3. WHEN the user views database and measurement lists THEN the system SHALL display them in a compact, information-dense format with monospace fonts.
4. WHEN the user hovers over UI elements THEN the system SHALL display tooltips with additional information or keyboard shortcuts.
5. WHEN the user performs operations THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status updates in a terminal-like format.
6. WHEN the application displays data THEN the system SHALL use syntax highlighting for query results and database structures.
7. WHEN the user navigates the application THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for common operations.
8. IF the user has customized their theme preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences while maintaining the geek-style aesthetic.
